The different types of errors:-
1) Error in syntax 
   * not closing enclosing the block propery.
   * not ending the executable statement with ;.
   * writing an executable or expression outside a method.
   * Not writing the keyword in smallcase.
   * Not writing the predefined classes in proper case.
   * accessing the non static member from static block.
   * restricting the access specefier of the overriding method.
   * we wrote a method with return type but not returning a value.
   * not writing the super keyword to access the base class
     constructor in the first line.
   * not writing the this keyword as a part of constructor call
     as a first line.
   * Accessing a private member outside the class.
   * when a class is public . The file name and class name 
     should be same.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Error in Logic. 
   * We are expecting an output that is different from the actual output. 
   * Writing testcases to test the code.
   * Debugger to find where the challenge is with the code. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Error during the runtime/execution of the code======> Exception
